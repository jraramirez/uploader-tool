## Setting Up Metadata Tables

When a new uploader is prepared, one of the requirements is to setup its metadata tables. There are two ways to setup the metadata tables of a new uploader.

### Method 1 - Use the Template
The metadata tables are setup by simply inserting values to the tables. There is a template (template.sql) that can be found here: https://github.hpe.com/TTT/uploader-tool/tree/master/uploader/sql
There are also samples that can be found in the link.

How to fill up the template: https://github.hpe.com/TTT/uploader-tool/blob/master/setup-template.md

### Method 2 - Use the Django Admin Page
